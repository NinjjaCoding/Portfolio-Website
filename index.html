        <h2>üìú Skills Acquired </h2>
            <p>
              This 3D rendered Profolio website and its four pages are examples of the coding skills and knowledge I have acquired. I'm highly interested in Blockchain technology, the Metaverses and the potential emerging economies inside these metaverses. I really liked coding, it came natural to me. 
              <br/>
              <br/> 
              In addition to HTML, CSS and Javascript, knowledge of  ES6 (async/await() => arrow functions are awesome), Web3.0, Smart Contracts, and Solidity programming using Remix, Truffle, Ganache, Chai, and Mocha frameworks, and use of testing networks like Rinkeby to test our codes.
          <br/> 
          <br/> 
              App developed with React-Native for Android and IOS,  as well as React for front-end apps, and Technologies like Vite, Parcel, hardhat, and webpack bundlers. 3D web development utilizing three.js libraries and webGLRendering. In-depth understanding of Wallets, Metamask, Binance Smart Chain & different blockchain networks. Have used & familiar with Blender, Unity, most of Adobe suites, NFTs and cryptocurrencies.  
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Before the Pandemic, I became interested and invested in Blockchain projects,  seeing 
              its potential to revolutionize the internet. My goal is to keep increasing my skills.

        <h2>üìú Objective </h2>
            <p>
              To obtain employment as an IT sales representative at one of the most prestigious technology companies and to gain more exposure to sales and marketing to further enhance my skills.
              Since the Pandemic began we have been mostly restricted at home. So I wanted to use the time to learn new skills. Coding had always interested me, and came natural to me. <br/>Enrolled in M.I.T Computer Science online courses to build the foundation of my Computer Science understanding; of coding, software development, App development Processes, App structures, Dapps, Web3.0, and 3D Website renderings.
        <br/>
        <br/>
              It's been a very cool journey of learning, and can manipulate and create new elements, functionalities, and it's fun making websites and apps do things I want.

          <h2>üìú Technology Sales Careers </h2>
        <p>
            This simple 3D website rendering was created to demonstrate the 10+ technologies, 5 programming languages, and nine different frameworks and libraries learned. This is not to brag about, though this is a resume, but to demonstrate that I'm well qualified in pursuit of combining two of my passions: Technolgy and Sales, and especially interested in Blockchain related positions. Highly enthusiastic and highly involved and invested in blockchain sector. Five years of Financial Sales Experience, and an in-depth understanding of banking systems, fiats and cryptocurrencies.
          <br/>
          <br/>
            I love people, talking to people, building rapport with them, and establishing long term B2B relationships 
            with them.  The use of highly adaptive linguistic skills to make communicating technical terms to non-technical clients a seamless transition, while at same time communicating seamlessly with developers using technical vocabulary, grammar and terms, will allow to be highly successful at this position.

          <h2>üèÜ Accomplishments</h2>
            <p>
              Recognized blockchain technology as the new internet and made investments in early Ethereum, and currently have IDO investments in other blockchain projects and Metaverses. These early investments allowed me to quite my job a few years ago before the lockdowns. During the lockdowns, I used the time to learn Solidity Programming, to understand Smart Contracts, build Blockchain Dapps and a host of other technologies and testing and development frameworks, libraries and networks.  
            <br/> <br/>
              Learned React-Native to build IOS and Android Applications. HTML, CSS, Javascript, Typescript, JQuerry and React.js to build front-end web apps and WordPress websites. Had several ecommerces before the lockdowns. The coolest part was learning three.js programming and using three.js libraries combined with WebGLRenderer to create and render really fun and cool 3D websites. 
         <br/>
         <br/>        
            Recognized blockchain as an entirely new way of immersive experience, the Matrix if you will, emerging with emergence of the 4th industrial revolution. An entirely new way of doing internet, shopping, business meetings and social meeting places. Metaverses, just like websites, will have a Metaverse Resource Locator addresses. Inside each Metaverses, people will live as their own Avatars, they will buy and sell mechandise, wrapped in the form of NFTs, and entirely new economies are emerging within each Metaverse and gaming worlds. Blockchain technology will usher in the 4th Industrial Revolution into reality. Just the potential new economies emerging within these Metaverses and gaming industries alone are enormous.
